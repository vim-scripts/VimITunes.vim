Allows controlling iTunes on Macintosh from within Vim.

Adds a menu "iTunes" that contains various commands to control iTunes.

Additionally, if the global variable "VimITunesMapPrefix" is set when this plugin is loaded, then several useful maps are created.  For example, if in your ".vimrc" you have

   let g:VimITunesMapPrefix = ",x"

then after this plugin is loaded, you can use the following maps:

       ,xq    Quit iTunes
       ,xs    Toggle Shuffle Mode
       ,xp    Toggle Pause Mode
       ,xl    Next Song
       ,xh    Previous Song
       ,xk    Volume Up
       ,xj    Volume Down
       ,xm    Mute
       ,x?    Display Song Title
       ,xd    Disable the current song
       ,xe    Enable the current song
